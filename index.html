                        Richey defined educational technology as "the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources".[4] The Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) denoted instructional technology as "the theory and practice of design, development, utilization, management, and evaluation of processes and resources for learning".[5][6][7]

                    <p>Given this definition, educational technology is an inclusive term for both the material tools and the theoretical foundations for supporting learning and teaching. Educational technology is not restricted to high technology.[8] Education technology is anything that enhances classroom learning in the utilization of blended, face to face, or online learning.[9]

                            However, modern electronic educational technology is an important part of society today.[10] Educational technology encompasses e-learning, instructional technology, information and communication technology (ICT) in education, EdTech, learning technology, multimedia learning, technology-enhanced learning (TEL), computer-based instruction (CBI), computer managed instruction, computer-based training (CBT), computer-assisted instruction or computer-aided instruction (CAI),[11] internet-based training (IBT), flexible learning, web-based training (WBT), online education, digital educational collaboration, distributed learning, computer-mediated communication, cyber-learning, and multi-modal instruction, virtual education, personal learning environments, networked learning, virtual learning environments (VLE) (which are also called learning platforms), m-learning, ubiquitous learning and digital education.

                    <p>Content and design architecture issues include pedagogy and learning object re-use. One approach looks at five aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fact – unique data (e.g. symbols for Excel formula, or the parts that make up a learning objective)</li>
                        <li>Concept – a category that includes multiple examples (e.g. Excel formulas, or the various types/theories of instructional design)</li>
                        <li>Process – a flow of events or activities (e.g. how a spreadsheet works, or the five phases in ADDIE)</li>
                        <li>Procedure – step-by-step task (e.g. entering a formula into a spreadsheet, or the steps that should be followed within a phase in ADDIE)</li>
                        <li>Strategic principle – task performed by adapting guidelines (e.g. doing a financial projection in a spreadsheet, or using a framework for designing learning environments)</li>
